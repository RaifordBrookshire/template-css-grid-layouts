## How to use these
Just clone the repo or just download the zip file and cut and past. All of these files have no dependencies and are just very simple HTML files. 

Of course when you start your project you can tweak the CSS and HTML in a single file to get the layout your looking for and actually test it in supported browsers. AT that time you could break the HTML into components (react, angular, MVC or your engine of choice... my current fav is Hugo!


Enjoy these are only for samples / examples they are so simple no need for support just tweak as needed!
